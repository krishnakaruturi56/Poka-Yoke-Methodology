<h1>Implementation of Poka-Yoke-Methodology</h1>

<h2> Problem Decsription: </h2>
<b>Ensuring Quality Control in Ford's Final Assembly Line Using Poka-Yoke and Tool Monitoring</b>
A critical issue was identified in hinge receiver components supplied for Fordâ€™s final assembly line, where the M6 tapped thread was missing, disrupting production and posing risks to both timelines and cost-efficiency. The defect was discovered late in the assembly process, requiring sorting at the customer facility and root cause analysis, which led to significant costs and delays.
Cost to Quality included $10872.86 for sorting all parts at customer facility and a strip down root cause of final assembly at Ford, causing interruptions.

<h2> Solution:</h2>
A comprehensive root cause analysis determined that the missing thread was caused by worn-out or broken tap and drill tools, which failed to produce the necessary M6 tapped thread. To address this, a Poka-Yoke approach was integrated into the machining process, incorporating the Renishaw TR-S2 Contact Probe for real-time tool monitoring. The system was programmed to check tools at the end of each cycle, automatically halting production if any tool was found to be damaged, broken, or worn beyond tolerance limits.

<h2> Key Benifits & Improvements:</h2>

- <b>Real-time Tool Monitoring: Proactive detection of tool wear or damage ensures high-quality parts and prevents defects from advancing through the production line.</b>
- <b>Reduced Delays: Immediate alerts and production halts minimized the risk of defective components, reducing costly sorting and downtime.</b>
- <b>Predictive Maintenance: By identifying tool wear early, the system enables better maintenance planning and reduces unexpected tool failures.</b>
- <b>Increased Efficiency: The streamlined process improved overall productivity by ensuring continuous production of high-quality parts without interruptions</b>
- <b>Enhanced Quality Control: The integration of tool monitoring significantly improved the consistency and reliability of the manufacturing process.</b>
